## About

I am a Physics PhD student at Boston University, working on the CMS Experiment at CERN. Currently, I'm working on the development of a Python based data analysis framework, [bucoffea](https://github.com/bu-cms/bucoffea). Interested in problems involving large scale data analysis and application of supervised/unsupervised machine learning to inference problems. Also interested in music and drumming.

## Several Projects

Here are links to repositories of several projects I am involved with:

- Python ([coffea](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea)) based data analysis framework: [bucoffea](https://github.com/bu-cms/bucoffea)
- Python based framework for submitting test jobs for CERN Monte Carlo requests, using [HTCondor](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor): [mcmtest](https://github.com/alpakpinar/mcmtest)
- Basic app based on React + Spotify API to search & play songs: [song-finder](https://song-finder-898a5.web.app/)
